USAGE
-----

1. Set JAVA_HOME to a Java 17 JDK of the same architecture.
2. Execute ./run.sh to run the detailed windowed sample, or execute
   ./run.sh simple to run the minimal windowed sample.
3. Optionally execute ./compile.sh to rebuild jcef-tests.jar.

The launcher explicitly selects JCEF's generic internally scheduled message
pump. Rinku integrations should set jcef.path themselves and continue driving
their configured external message pump.
