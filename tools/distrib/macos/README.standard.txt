The distributed app intentionally uses CEF 151's flat framework layout. This
preserves a link-free archive that Rinku's hardened extractor accepts. The CEF
framework and enclosing app are ad-hoc signed after this deterministic
packaging transform and are verified with codesign --deep --strict.

USAGE
-----

1. Install a Java 17 runtime matching this distribution's architecture.
2. Launch jcef_app.app to run the detailed windowed sample.
3. Optionally set JAVA_HOME to a matching JDK 17 and execute ./compile.sh to
   rebuild the samples. The script re-signs the modified app bundle.
